Code repository for [_Aereo_](https://dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au/aereo/), an experimental bird‚Äôs eye view of the digital collections from the State Library of New South Wales by [Mauricio Giraldo Arteaga](https://github.com/mgiraldo/) for the [2019 DX Lab Fellowship](https://dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au/blog/winner-dx-lab-fellowship-3).

## Data download

To download these files you need to know how to use [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). The files are located in this bucket:

```
https://dxlab-fellowship-2019.s3.amazonaws.com/
```

All files are in their own subfolder in that bucket and <a href="https://dxlab-fellowship-2019.s3.amazonaws.com/csv/all.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mapped in this CSV</a> (85 MB). The CSV has three columns: `id`, `filename`, `access_pid`. This is really one of the CSVs listed below in ‚ÄúFile ID to URL mapping‚Äù that contains every file.

### Colour summaries

This is the color information extracted from every image like histogram, colour palette, and more. There are two versions: full and compact. The compact version is the one used by <em>Aereo</em> and only includes:

- the five more prominent colours (palette)
- percentage amount for each colour
- text names for each colour

The two groups of files are not consistently named (because long story üò≥) and follow this structure:

#### Full version

<dl>
  <dt>Folder</dt>
  <dd><code>colors_output</code></dd>
  <dt>Type</dt>
  <dd>JSON</dd>
  <dt>Naming convention</dt>
  <dd>Based on the file <code>access_pid</code> (e.g.: <code>[BUCKET]/colors_output/110000148.json</code>).</dd>
</dl>

#### Compact version

<dl>
  <dt>Folder</dt>
  <dd><code>colors_minimal</code></dd>
  <dt>Type</dt>
  <dd>JSON</dd>
  <dt>Naming convention</dt>
  <dd>Based on the file <code>id</code> (e.g.: <code>[BUCKET]/colors_minimal/0A3Z4x84Z0wq.json</code>).</dd>
</dl>

### Image predictions

<dl>
  <dt>Folder</dt>
  <dd><code>predictions</code></dd>
  <dt>Type</dt>
  <dd>Gzipped JSON</dd>
  <dt>Naming convention</dt>
  <dd>Based on the file <code>id</code> (e.g.: <code>[BUCKET]/predictions/0A3Z4x84Z0wq.json.gz</code>).</dd>
</dl>

These are the object recognition predictions for every image. These are 4,096 newline-separated values from 0 to 1 saved as gzipped JSON but no real JSON structure is used.

### Image similarity

<dl>
  <dt>Folder</dt>
  <dd><code>similarities</code></dd>
  <dt>Type</dt>
  <dd>Multiple, see below</dd>
</dl>

These are the similarity calculations for each category of files in _Aereo_. The internal names of the categories are:

- `archTechDrawings`
- `newspapers`
- `coin`
- `drawings`
- `ephemera`
- `journals`
- `manuscripts`
- `manuscriptMaps`
- `maps`
- `medals`
- `negatives`
- `objects`
- `paintings`
- `photographs`
- `pictures`
- `posters`
- `prints`
- `stamps`

For each category there are **four files**: three [Python Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) files and one text file. The Pickle files are the in-between steps for converting the 4,096 object recognitions above into the square grid that is used in _Aereo_. The code for this process is available in [this repository](https://github.com/mgiraldo/image-utils), where [this file](https://github.com/mgiraldo/image-utils/blob/master/similar_csv.py) is the one outputting the Pickle and text files.

#### Pickles

The process includes:

- converting the 4,096 down to the 300 most informative values via [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). <br />Filename: `[CATEGORY]_pca.p` (e.g.: `[BUCKET]/similarities/prints_pca.p`);
- shaping those 300 into a three-dimensional space using [t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding). I later replaced this with [Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which is much faster (but kept the original t-SNE anyway). <br />Filename: `[CATEGORY]_[tsne or umap].p` (e.g.: `[BUCKET]/similarities/prints_umap.p`);
- converting the three-dimensional space into a two-dimensional grid using [RasterFairy](https://github.com/Quasimondo/RasterFairy) and producing a newline-separated list of `x y` coordinates for each file in the category and starting with a `COLUMNS ROWS` line. The `photographs` category wouldn't work in RasterFairy so it was gridded using [Lagrangian Gradient Descent](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16-eM-t3ZevY72I1gBQUSnUZnFkL2GG0h#scrollTo=ROJMfqIzzSw2).<br />Filename: `[CATEGORY].txt` (e.g.: `[BUCKET]/similarities/prints.txt`)

### Image thumbnails

There are two folders, one with 150x150 pixel thumbnails (folder `150_150`) and one with 32x32 pixel thumbnails (folder `32_32`). Both have the same naming convention but the 32x32 has PNG files and the 150x150 has JPEG files (I have no good explanation for this difference üò≥): `[first_four_characters_of_filename]/filename.[png or jpg]` (e.g.: `[BUCKET]/32_32/1000/10000130.png` and `[BUCKET]/150_150/1000/10000130.jpg`).
